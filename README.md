Provides an up-to-date RSS product feed for Google Merchant rather a file that you have to upload. This is a very basic extension so feel free to help improve it!

To test and access the RSS feed visit:
`http://locahost:3000/google_merchant.rss`

## Installation & Usage

To start with you'll need a Google Merchant account. Then, add the gem to your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem "spree_google_merchant", github: 'boombotix/spree_google_merchant.git'
```

Then bundle

```ruby
bundle install
```

Then (if you wish to customize the feed), install the config/initializers/google_merchant.rb file:

```ruby
rails g spree_google_merchant:install
```

You can view the initializer to get an idea how to customize things.

Next, configure the feed title, description and site URL by browsing to the Google Merchant settings page in `Admin -> Configuration`

Finally, set up your products in Spree by editing the product's properties.  You should add the following properties:

```sh
google_product_type
manufacturer
brand
model
upc
```

## Testing
In order to run the rspec test suite:

```ruby
rake test_app
rake spec
```
